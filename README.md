This project predicts the Sharp/van der Heijde score (SHS) for hand radiographs through three phases, orientation, joint detection, damage prediction. The results of this analysis have been posted on Medrxiv and can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.06.08.22276135). The overview of this study as follows.
